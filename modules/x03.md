## Module 3: Accessing the K8s Nodes

Goal: In this module, you will access the k8s nodes and prep the installation of k8s.

### Steps

1. ssh into the `jumpbox` node using its public IP. This was provided in the terraform output.


2. From the `jumpbox` node, you can now ssh into nodes: `master`, `worker-1`, and `worker-2` using their **private** ip address that was provided in the output of the `terraform apply` step.



3. On the `jumpbox` node, there is a script named `/home/calico-fortinet/0-install-kubeadm.sh`. Copy this script to the `master`, `worker-1`, and `worker-2` nodes and run it.
